# Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a model to predict future sales based on historical sales data, seasonality, and external factors like economic indicators. Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses plan inventory, manage cash flow, and make informed strategic decisions.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Gather and preprocess data related to historical sales, economic indicators, and other relevant external factors. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Historical sales data, economic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation rates), seasonal data (e.g., holidays, events).
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, feature scaling.

### 2. Time Series Analysis
Analyze the time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns that are crucial for accurate forecasting.

- **Techniques Used:** Decomposition of time series, autocorrelation analysis, seasonality detection.

### 3. Model Building
Build and evaluate different models to forecast future sales. Compare their performance to select the best model.

- **Techniques Used:** Regression models, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
- **Outcome:** A robust model capable of accurately predicting future sales.

### 4. Data Visualization
Visualize historical data, model predictions, and key trends to communicate findings effectively.

- **Techniques Used:** Plotting time series data, forecasting results, trend analysis using data visualization libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales_forecasting.git
   cd sales_forecasting
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
### Data Preparation
1. Place raw data files in the data/raw/ directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
   
### Running the Notebooks
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
3. Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to process data, analyze time series, build models, and visualize results:
 - data_preprocessing.ipynb
 - time_series_analysis.ipynb
 - model_building.ipynb
 - data_visualization.ipynb

### Training Models
1. Train the sales forecasting model:
   
    ```bash
    python src/model_building.py
    
### Results and Evaluation
 - Sales Forecasting: The model should accurately predict future sales based on historical data, seasonality, and economic indicators.
 - Data Visualization: Visualizations should effectively communicate historical trends, model predictions, and key insights.
